# PukiWiki Editor

PukiWiki Editor is a Chrome extension for more comfortable use of the PukiWiki editing page.
It was created for PukiWiki, which is used in the Particle Physics Laboratory of the Faculty of Science at Kobe University, so it is localised to it.
(The location where PukiWiki is hosted is hard-coded.)
If you want to use it on another PukiWiki, you will have to edit the code yourself.
